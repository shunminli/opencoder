//! # opencoder-team
//!
//! Multi-agent team-discussion orchestration runtime. A **team** (captain +
//! members, each backed by a registered worker node) discusses a **topic**
//! over rounds:
//!
//! 1. **plan** (decision ①) — the captain picks the round's question and
//!    participating members;
//! 2. **sub-turns** — members answer (sub 0) or clarify ambiguities
//!    (sub ≥ 1, only for members the captain flagged); decision ② summarizes
//!    and judges alignment after every sub-turn;
//! 3. **closing** (decision ③) — the captain completes the topic or opens
//!    another round, bounded by `max_turns` / `max_sub_turns`.
//!
//! All durable state lives on an NFS-shared `team_root` directory tree
//! (atomic tmp+rename writes, see [`fs_store`]); execution position is fully
//! derived from that tree ([`cursor`]), so **`run_topic` is resume**: a
//! crashed/errored topic continues where its files stop. The
//! `(topic, node)` ledger in the store's `team_topic_runs` table tracks which
//! nodes are (or were) working which topic. Capability profiling
//! ([`profile_team`]) fills each member's `capabilities` for better planning.
