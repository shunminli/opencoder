//! `opencoder ts` (alias `rs`) -- run the TUI inside a tmux session that
//! survives SSH disconnect. A bare `ts`/`rs` always starts a fresh managed
//! session; `ts -l` lists them **globally**, `ts -r <id>` reattaches, and
//! `ts -d <id>` removes one exact managed session.
//!
//! `ts -l` is tmux-first and global: every live managed tmux session from
//! every workdir is listed with its real workdir path (`pane_current_path`,
//! `$HOME` abbreviated to `~`), enriched with `/task` info from the central ts
//! registry (`<data_root>/ts.db`); stopped sessions come from that registry
//! (one indexed query — no per-store scan), but only when they were actually
//! started — plain `tui`/`run` sessions and never-started empty seeds are
//! never listed.
//!
//! tmux is engaged ONLY when `opencoder ts`/`rs` is used. Plain `tui`, `run`,
//! headless and server commands are completely unaffected.
//!
//! Safety: every tmux argument is passed via `Command::arg(...)` -- tmux runs
//! the pane command with execvp, never a shell -- so session names cannot
//! inject shell metacharacters.
//!
//! Naming contract: a managed tmux session is named `opencoder-<ulid>` where the
//! ulid is also a real opencoder session id (seeded into the store). That gives
//! one stable id shared by tmux and the session store, so `ts -l` can show
//! `/task`-style info and `ts -r <id>` resolves unambiguously. Each store also
//! carries a canonical `workdir` marker, so stopped sessions keep their path
//! and can be resumed globally from any directory.
