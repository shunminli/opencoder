//! Shared step semantics for `ChatBlock::StepGroup` — one implementation used
//! by BOTH the live streaming path (`ChatView::apply`) and replay
//! (`session_ui::replay`), so step boundaries never drift between them.
//!
//! A step is one reasoning run plus every function call that follows it.
//! Function-call completion and provider-round boundaries do not split a
//! step: calls keep accumulating until the next reasoning run begins.
//!
//! A user turn owns one `StepGroup` per Say-closed sub-turn: live updates
//! use the explicit `turn_block_start` boundary (advanced below every
//! newly-opened Say), while replay canonicalizes message pairs at real
//! `User` blocks and the `Assistant` Says that cap each sub-turn.
//! Every user input is a Turn boundary — a submit (`ChatView::begin_turn`),
//! a consumed steer, or a consumed queued prompt re-anchors the floor below
//! its echo (`ChatView::reanchor_turn_after_user_echo`), so each turn
//! renders its own `N Steps + Say` pair and never merges into a previous
//! turn's ladder.
//!
//! Thinking absorption: every round's reasoning lives strictly step-local —
//! the pending `Thinking` blocks trailing the flow (even behind the turn's
//! own `Assistant` speech) are folded into the step the next `ToolStart`
//! opens, and a round whose NO tool call ever follows (pure-text round, or a
//! turn's final Say round) is flushed into a call-less step at the run-end /
//! boundary pushes via `flush_pending_thinking`. Thinking therefore never
//! survives as a top-level block at rest. `coalesce_steps` applies the same
//! fold on replay.
