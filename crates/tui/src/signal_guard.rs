//! Process-wide termination-signal guard for the captured terminal.
//!
//! `TerminalGuard::enter()` enables raw mode + alt-screen + mouse capture +
//! bracketed paste. If the process dies from a termination signal before
//! `TerminalGuard::drop` runs, the host terminal keeps **mouse reporting
//! enabled** — after exit every click or drag prints escape garbage
//! (`M#…`/`[M…`) into the shell. The liveness supervisor covers this too, but
//! only from the moment it is spawned (inside `run_app` / onboarding), leaving
//! a boot window — terminal captured, supervisor not yet armed — where a
//! `SIGTERM`/`SIGHUP` (tmux kill-pane, ssh drop) bricked the terminal.
//!
//! This guard is armed by `TerminalGuard::enter()` itself, so signal-driven
//! restoration is live from the first millisecond the terminal is captured,
//! on every path (onboarding wizard, chat loop, shutdown). It is a
//! **process-wide singleton** (latched once): the liveness supervisor no
//! longer registers signals itself, keeping a single writer for the restore
//! sequences (two threads racing `restore()` could interleave identical
//! escape sequences into garbage).
