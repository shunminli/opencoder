//! Terminal lifecycle: enter alt-screen/raw/mouse/kitty mode on construction,
//! restore it on `Drop` — including from a panic.
//!
//! Previously the setup/teardown lived inline in `app::run`, and the teardown
//! ran only when `run_app` returned normally. A panic anywhere inside the app
//! unwound past the cleanup, leaving the terminal in raw mode + alternate
//! screen + mouse capture: to the user that is indistinguishable from a freeze
//! (last frame frozen, typing has no echo, Ctrl+C/D ineffective) and requires
//! killing the process and often `reset`-ing the shell.
//!
//! The guard makes restoration an RAII invariant: the `Drop` runs on every exit
//! path (normal, `?` error, panic=unwind). A panic hook additionally restores
//! *before* the default hook prints, so a backtrace is readable in the restored
//! terminal rather than buried in the alternate screen.
