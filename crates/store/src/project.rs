/// - Every `patch_*` builds its `SET` clause from the patch's `Some` fields
///   only; a patch with every field `None` is a caller bug (it would produce
///   an invalid empty `SET`).
/// - `delete_*` returns `false` when the id does not exist.
/// - Goal deletion detaches initiatives; nonempty initiatives reject deletion.
///   TODO deletion also removes its runs in the same libsql transaction.
/// - Status/kind strings round-trip exactly; an unrecognized status on read is
///   corruption and propagates as an error.
