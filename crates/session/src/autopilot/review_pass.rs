//! One-shot automatic review pass (`autopilot.mode = "review"`): after the
//! initial task completes, activate the review skill, inject a synthetic
//! review prompt, run a single `run_loop`, then clear the skill and finish.
//! Unlike [`crate::autopilot::drive`] there is no ACT/VERIFY loop — exactly
//! one review turn, then control returns.
//!
//! The pass is read-only and agent-agnostic: the runner dispatch layer admits
//! it for ANY primary agent (the reviewer stays on whatever agent ran the
//! initial task — no switch, no fold). `review` is dispatched after a
//! completed run regardless of whether that agent was `act` or `plan`.
