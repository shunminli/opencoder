//! Autopilot: a self-driving PLAN -> ACT -> VERIFY loop.
//!
//! When `config.autopilot.mode` is `"ap"` the session runner hands control to
//! [`drive`] after the initial task. Each iteration:
//!
//! - **PLAN** — switch to the plan agent (read-only explorer), activate
//!   the task-plan skill (unlocking the latent `question` tool), inject a
//!   continuation prompt, run one loop. Plan turns stay in the transcript
//!   (legitimate work record).
//! - **ACT** — reset the transcript via execution handoff (ACT sees only the
//!   brief as its execution instruction), switch to the act agent, run one
//!   loop. Inject an execute prompt only as a fallback when no handoff brief
//!   is found.
//! - **VERIFY** — an isolated *shadow* one-shot: it clones the current
//!   transcript into a throwaway snapshot, asks a small model "is the goal
//!   fully achieved?", parses a single yes/no, then discards the snapshot.
//!   Nothing is recorded or persisted — the main transcript is never polluted
//!   by the judgement exchange.
//!
//! The loop stops when VERIFY says "yes" (complete), retries exhaust without
//! a parseable verdict (aborted — the reason distinguishes an unparseable
//! judge from an unreachable one), the session is cancelled, or
//! `max_iterations` is hit. The existing doom-loop / tool-failure / cancel
//! guards inside `run_loop` still terminate individual phase runs.
