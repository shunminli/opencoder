//! Queueable control commands: `/act`, `/plan`, `/act_clear_context`
//! (`/clear_context` is the accepted legacy alias).
//!
//! These slash commands switch the runtime agent and/or clear the transcript.
//! They take effect *immediately* when consumed by the drain loop. Pure mode
//! switches do not consume an LLM turn; a clear with preserved context does,
//! so act can continue from the seed or execute the preserved plan. Public UI
//! admission rejects them while a run is active; the runner parser remains so
//! idle submissions and persisted/internal recovery inputs stay deterministic:
//!
//! ```text
//! queue: [/plan] -> [review skill] -> [/act]
//! drain: switch->plan (no turn) . run "review" . switch->act (no turn)
//! ```
//!
//! Integration points (all in [`crate::runner`]):
//! - **Idle short-circuit** ([`run_with_registry`]): when the idle prompt is a
//!   control command, apply it and return without entering [`run_loop`].
//! - **Queue intercept** (run_loop idle boundary): drain consecutive control
//!   commands without an LLM turn until a real prompt arrives.
//! - **Steer intercept** (run_loop turn boundary, defensive): a steered control
//!   command is applied immediately instead of being recorded as user text.
