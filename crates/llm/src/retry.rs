//! Every retry-vs-fail-vs-done decision (both the pre-stream connection loop
//! and the mid-stream interruption loop) is a pure function of an abstract
//! outcome + attempt counter, kept free of I/O so the boundary logic — the part

//!
//! Two retry budgets exist, kept deliberately separate:
//! - [`MAX_ATTEMPTS`] — pre-stream connection/HTTP-status retries (handled by
//!   `connect_with_retry` in `client.rs`). Fires before any byte is streamed.
//! - [`MAX_STREAM_ATTEMPTS`] — mid-stream retries after the connection is up and
//!   bytes have started flowing (chunk read errors, truncated streams, idle
//!   stalls). See `run_stream` in `client.rs`.
