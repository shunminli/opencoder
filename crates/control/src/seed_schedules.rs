//! One-time import of the legacy `schedules.json` definitions into the
//! libsql `schedules` table (schema v27).
//!
//! Since v27 the table is the scheduler's definition source of truth and
//! the JSON file degrades to a seed input: on boot, ONLY when the table is
//! empty, every valid file entry is imported (invalid entries are warned
//! and skipped — the file was previously fail-soft too). Once definitions
//! exist, the file is dead weight for job bodies; a server restart must
//! never resurrect a definition the operator deleted, so the import is
//! strictly table-empty gated: skip the import instead of merging definitions.
//! `scan_interval_secs` keeps its file role forever — see `scheduler`.
