//! Seeding of the built-in and dependency-gated skill packs.

//! Everything that *writes* to `~/.opencoder/skills` on startup lives here:
//! the embedded skill tables ([`BUILTIN_SKILLS`] / [`DEP_GATED_SKILLS`]), the
//! per-file incremental seeders, and the optional-deps install script. The
//! read side of the module (discovery, parsing, skill tokens) stays in
//! [`crate::skill`].
//!
//! Clobber policy: built-in packs update on drift (a drifted file is backed
//! up to `<file>.user.bak` and overwritten with the shipped asset, so skill
//! fixes ride binary upgrades), while dependency-gated packs keep their
//! per-file never-clobber guarantee.
