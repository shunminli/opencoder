//! Pre-parse bound on the *shape* of a command string.
//!
//! Ported from rippy `src/nesting.rs` (MIT, https://github.com/mpecan/rippy).
//! Sandbox delta: none — the only change is an edition-2021 rewrite of two
//! let-chains.
//!
//! rable parses by recursive descent, and a stack overflow *aborts* the process
//! instead of unwinding, which the hook's `catch_unwind` fail-closed net cannot
//! convert into an Ask (#195). Two things keep that from happening: the parse
//! runs on a deep stack (`parser::parse_on_a_deep_stack`), and the shapes that
//! recurse without any ceiling are counted here and refused.
//!
//! The scan is a genuine *over*-approximation: it never skips a span and never
//! cancels a count. Anything that tries to track quoting has to decide what a
//! `'` inside a comment, a heredoc body or `$'\''` means, and one wrong guess
//! desyncs the lexer into skipping the very nesting it is there to measure
//! (#195 again). Counting openers and never matching a closer needs no such
//! guess, so no input — however malformed — can make the count come out low.
//! see docs/security-invariants.md#parser-stack-bound
