//! `shellguard` -- shell command safety classifier for sandbox mode.
//!
//! Classification core extracted from [rippy](https://github.com/mpecan/rippy)
//! (MIT license, copyright the rippy authors) and adapted to the sandbox
//! policy: every risk-bearing write is blocked; writes targeting `/dev/null`
//! or `/tmp` are released; the working directory is NOT a release set.
//! `Allow` passes; `Ask`/`Deny` block. Unregistered (unknown) commands are
//! allow-by-default — a policy choice, surfaced as typed
//! [`AllowReason::UnknownCommand`] provenance — while unparseable input and
//! dynamic command names keep failing closed.
//!
//! Pipeline: [`nesting`] bounds the input shape, [`parser`] turns it into a
//! rable AST, [`ast`] classifies nodes, [`resolve`] statically resolves shell
//! expansions, and [`analyzer`] walks the tree down into the per-command
//! [`handlers`] registry. Everything funnels through [`classify`].
