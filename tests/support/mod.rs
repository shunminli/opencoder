//! Shared helpers for the root-package fleet e2e tests: resolving the
//! workspace-sibling fleet binaries (`opencoder-server`, `opencoder-agent`)
//! from the same target dir as this package's own `opencoder` binary.

//! # Prerequisite
//!
//! The fleet smokes in this package spawn the split server/agent binaries,
//! which only exist in the shared target dir after a workspace build. Run
//! what [`FLEET_BINS_HINT`] says before running tests. `cargo test
//! --workspace` can build only a sibling's test harness and leave its
//! executable stale. Missing or mismatched siblings fail fast.
