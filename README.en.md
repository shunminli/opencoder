> ## ⚠️ Risk Notice: This project trusts the model 100% and enforces NO permission checks
>
> **OpenCoder has no permission interception and no sandbox.** Once started, the model is granted **exactly the same** privileges as your OS user: it can read, write, modify, and delete any file reachable by your account, and execute any shell command (including `rm`, `git push --force`, writing to databases, network downloads, etc.) **without any secondary confirmation prompt.**
>
> In other words, **running OpenCoder is equivalent to handing full control of this machine to the model.**
>
> Before using it, please:
>
> - 📌 **Assess the risk first**: only use it if you accept that "the model may delete/overwrite any file and run any command."
> - 💾 **Back up important data**: back up or version-control the code, data, and configs you care about, and make sure the backup lives outside any directory this process can write to.
> - 🔐 **Isolate the environment**: run it inside a container, VM, or a dedicated low-privilege account. Never run it directly on a production server or in a working directory that holds sensitive credentials (API keys / private keys / DB connection strings).
> - 👀 **Stay attentive**: in headless `run` and `serve` modes commands execute automatically; keep the working directory and privilege scope within your control.
>
> **If you do not trust the model, please do not use this project without adequate backups and isolation.** The author is not liable for any data loss or damage caused by the model's behavior.

OpenCoder is a fully independent, Rust-native coding agent implemented from scratch. It ships a single binary `opencoder` that offers **four working modes**: an **interactive TUI**, **headless one-shot execution**, a **centralized HTTP/SSE server**, and a **remote thin client**. All upper-layer logic depends on only two abstraction seams — `Arc<dyn Store>` and `Arc<dyn ChatStream>` — so both the persistence layer (libsql) and the LLM backend (OpenAI-compatible) are swappable.

## ✨ Features

- **🧠 Multi-mode runtime** — Local TUI and headless `run` share the session runtime; dedicated `opencoder-server` and `opencoder-agent` binaries provide Fleet control and node execution.
- **🔄 Session resume & fork** — `--session <id>` / `--continue` / `--fork` rebuild history from libsql across processes; titles are generated asynchronously by the small model.
- **📦 Session binary export/import** — `session export/import` carries the full subagent tree in a `.opencoder` binary (`OPENCODR` magic) for migration; idempotent and never exports Config (API key safe).
- **🛠️ Subagent scheduling** — two subagent kinds, `explore` (read-only investigation) and `build` (implementation execution), with DB-tracked lifecycles and collapsible views.
- **📋 Plan / Act dual mode** — Plan mode is read-only (bash writes are blocked by `bash_guard`); switching to Act clears the context and keeps only the final plan.
- **🗜️ Auto-compaction** — token-estimate-driven context compression; `compaction.{auto,context_threshold,reserved,tail_turns,buffer}` is fully configurable.
- **🎮 Steer / follow-up two-phase delivery** — inject steer instantly at turn boundaries while running; consume exactly one queued follow-up when idle.
- **🌐 Lossless event replay** — SSE event schema v2 migration; `SessionEvent` is the single source of truth, and replay fully rebuilds tool blocks.
- **⚡ High performance** — cold start ~6 ms, binary 9.3 MB (thin-LTO + strip); libsql WAL concurrent read/write, appending 1k messages in 30 ms.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Native Windows 11 x64 support covers the TUI and operator node with stable PowerShell 7.4 or newer in the 7.x series. See [Windows installation and scope](docs/windows.md).

> 👉 New to OpenCoder? See the [**Quick Start guide**](docs/quickstart.en.md) — TUI keys, browsing/editing files with notepad, attaching notes to tasks, and more.

### Installation

Build from source (requires a Rust toolchain):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MoSunDay/opencoder.git
cd opencoder
cargo build --release
# Binary located at target/release/opencoder
```

Platform prerequisites (building from source):

- **Linux**: `cargo build --release` works out of the box with the full feature set (including the `opencoder-agent` node).
- **macOS**: builds and runs `opencoder` (CLI/TUI) and `opencoder-server`; run `xcode-select --install` and `brew install cmake` first (the libsql `libsql-ffi` dependency needs libclang and cmake). On macOS, session child processes run as direct children (no Linux pidfd supervision), and the `opencoder-agent` node (runc sandbox, process supervision) is Linux-only.

Or use the install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoSunDay/opencoder/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Configuration

On the first interactive launch, OpenCoder creates `~/.opencoder/config.json` and opens an in-TUI model setup form when the effective configuration is not yet usable. After the provider, model, endpoint, and API key pass local validation, the same TUI continues directly to the task composer. Existing usable project or environment configuration is honored without prompting.

Place an `opencoder.json` in the project root or `~/.opencoder/` (env vars and CLI flags take higher precedence):

```jsonc
{
  "model": "openai/glm-4.6",
  "small_model": "openai/glm-4.5-air",
  "context_limit": 128000,
  "max_tokens": 8000,
  "reasoning_effort": "medium",
  "compaction": { "auto": true, "context_threshold": 0.8 },
  "providers": {
    "deepseek": {
      "base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1",
      "api_key": "{DEEPSEEK_API_KEY}",
      "model": "deepseek-chat",
      "headers": [{ "name": "X-Region", "value": "eu" }]
    }
  }
}
```

`model` uses the format `"{provider}/{model_id}"`; the provider name matches a key in the `providers` map (falls back to the default `provider` if unmatched). `api_key` and header `value` support `{ENV_VAR}` indirection.

### Three usage modes

```bash
# 1) Interactive TUI
opencoder

# 2) Headless one-shot run, output to stdout
opencoder run "Implement an LRU cache in Rust with tests"

# 3) Start the Fleet server and connect an execution node from another machine
opencoder-server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --token-file /secure/path/token
opencoder-agent --remote http://SERVER:8080 --name worker-1 --token-file /secure/path/token
```

## 🧱 Architecture

OpenCoder is a Cargo workspace with layered dependencies. Its main crates include:

| Crate | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `core` | Shared types and `Config` (model / compaction / context window / small_model, all configurable) |
| `llm` | OpenAI-compatible streaming client + `ChatStream` trait + `MockChatClient` + token estimator |
| `store` | `Store` trait + libsql implementation (WAL, embedded), the sole outlet for all persistence |
| `session` | Runtime core: drain main loop, tool registration, subagent scheduling, plan bash guard, compaction, resume |
| `tui` | ratatui interactive UI (3-pane layout, subagent folding, steer/follow-up, plan/act switch) |
| `web` | axum HTTP + SSE session management (prompt admit / event stream / runtime switch / interrupt) |
| `control` / `server` | Fleet HTTP control plane and dedicated server binary |
| `node` / `worker` / `agent` | Node connection, execution adapters, and dedicated node binary |
| `local` / `ctl` | Local interactive and headless frontend, Fleet management CLI |
| `brain` / `dag` / `team` / `todos` | Orchestration capabilities and execution contracts |

**Key abstractions:**

- **`Store` trait** (`crates/store/src/store.rs`) — unified CRUD for sessions / messages / inputs / events / subagent_tasks; the only seam for swapping SQLite implementations.
- **`ChatStream` trait** (`crates/llm/src/stream.rs`) — implemented by both `ChatClient` (real) and `MockChatClient`, enabling zero-token deterministic testing of the session runtime.
- **drain semantics** (`crates/session/src/runner.rs::run_loop`) — promotes steer at every turn boundary; when idle it consumes exactly one queued item; a doom-loop guard (`DOOM_THRESHOLD=20`) breaks consecutive empty turns.

## 📊 Comparison with opencode

OpenCoder and [sst/opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) (a TypeScript / Node SEA implementation) target the same "coding agent" use case, but their runtime baseline overhead differs significantly. The table below is a **measured runtime-baseline comparison** (not an end-to-end task benchmark), reproducible on the same machine under the same load.

**Test environment:** Intel Xeon E5-2673 v3 @ 2.40GHz · 24 cores · Ubuntu 22.04 (Linux 6.8) · 2026-07-19

**Methodology:** workload = `--help` (the minimal workload, reflecting the runtime's own overhead and excluding LLM RTT); peak memory via *Maximum resident set size* from `/usr/bin/time -v`; 5 samples each, median reported.

| Metric | opencode `1.17.8` | opencoder `0.1.0` | Difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime | Node SEA (V8, single executable app) | Rust-native single binary | — |
| Binary size | **159 MiB** (166,885,504 B) | **11.1 MiB** (11,644,304 B) | opencode is **14.3×** larger |
| Cold-start peak RSS | **~197 MiB** (195–199 MB) | **~5.4 MiB** (5.2–5.6 MB) | opencode is **35×** higher |
| Cold-start time | **~0.78 s** | **~6 ms** | opencode is **~125×** slower |
| Cold-start token overhead | **~13k tok** | **~0.4k tok** | opencode **~32×** higher |
| Protocol | OpenAI-compatible + ACP + MCP | OpenAI-compatible + subagents (explore/build) | — |
| Session storage | SQLite (WAL) + Drizzle ORM | libsql (SQLite-compatible, WAL) + hand-written `Store` trait | Both SQLite; see [storage comparison](#-storage) below |

> **Cold-start token overhead** methodology: take each agent's first request body sent to the LLM, count tokens in the `system` message + the `tools` array (the fixed first-turn cost, incurred before any user input) with the `cl100k_base` BPE. Measured independently from the other `--help` runtime-baseline rows above. This is a fixed cost re-paid on every conversation turn.

### 🗄️ Storage

Both are **SQLite under the hood**, persisting as standard `.db` + `.db-wal` + `.db-shm` (WAL mode); the differences are at the driver layer and table model:

| Dimension | opencode `1.17.8` | opencoder `0.1.0` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Database | SQLite (embedded in bun) | libsql `0.9.30` (SQLite-compatible, `core` + `libsql-sys`) |
| Access layer | Drizzle ORM (JS, runtime migrations via `migration` table) | Hand-written SQL + `Store` trait (`crates/store/src/store.rs`) |
| Driver language | JS/V8 ↔ SQLite C ABI | Rust ↔ libsql C ABI (zero-copy binding) |
| WAL PRAGMA | `journal_mode=WAL`, `synchronous=NORMAL`, `busy_timeout=5000`, `cache_size=-64000`, `foreign_keys=ON` | `journal_mode=WAL` (same concurrency model) |
| Tables (core) | `session` / `message` / `step` / `agent` / `tool_use` / `snapshot` / `checkpoint` / `event` / `subagent` | `sessions` / `messages` / `session_inputs` / `session_events` / `subagent_tasks` / `schema_version` |
| Migration | Drizzle migration (runtime diff against `migration` table + `meta/_journal.json`) | Single `schema_version` value + idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` |
| DB file naming | `opencode.db` (varies by channel, e.g. `opencode-dev.db`) | Determined by workdir (one DB per workdir) |

> Both share an equivalent WAL concurrency model (many readers / one writer; reads never block writes). Storage throughput differences mainly come from the driver layer — opencode goes through Drizzle ORM + V8 cross-language hops, while opencoder talks directly to the libsql C binding with no ORM translation layer.

> Note: end-to-end task performance is LLM-dominated (first-token latency is the provider RTT); under the same model both projects are essentially neck-and-neck in actual task throughput. The comparison above isolates the **runtime baseline** — the cost the runtime itself imposes regardless of the LLM.

Using "implement a terminal Snake game in Rust + crossterm" as a control task, both invoked the same way:

```bash
# opencode (Node SEA)
opencode run --model zhipuai-coding-plan/glm-5.2 "Implement terminal Snake..."

# opencoder (Rust native)
opencoder run "Implement terminal Snake..."
```

**Measured comparison (2026-07-19, same machine, same model glm-5.2, isolated workdirs, 0.5 s sampling throughout):**
**Scope: only "non-compilation periods" are counted — the agent main process itself, with no cargo/rustc child process running (samples where `npids<=1`). Fully symmetric on both sides, completely excluding compilation contributions.**

| Metric | opencode `1.17.8` | opencoder `0.1.0` | Difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task completion time (wall) | 172.3 s | 112.2 s | LLM sampling noise is large; reference only |
| Non-compilation sample share | 313 / 321 (97.5%) | 199 / 209 (95.2%) | Compilation share is small for both |
| **Avg CPU utilization** | **55.3%** (sustained high) | **0.13%** (event-driven, idle while waiting on LLM) | opencode **~425×** higher |
| CPU median (p50) | **44.6%** (≥44% half the time) | **0.0%** (fully 0 half the time) | Fundamental difference |
| CPU p95 | 115.2% | 1.9% | opencode **~61×** higher |
| CPU peak | 2631.6% (V8 GC/JIT, transient ≈26 cores) | 3.7% | — |
| **Agent process RSS avg** | **451.7 MB** | **11.8 MB** | opencode **~38×** higher |
| Agent process RSS peak | 557.5 MB | 12.1 MB | opencode **~47×** higher |
| Result | compiles, 242 lines | compiles, 351 lines | — |

> **Key: opencode's high CPU is unrelated to compilation (self-proven by the data).** The opencode 2631.6% CPU-peak sample was verified to have `npids=1` (no cargo child running at that instant) — it is a pure V8 GC/JIT burst. Moreover, after stripping all compilation periods, opencode's average CPU did not drop but rose slightly (full-run 54.4% → non-compilation 55.3%). In other words, during "waiting for LLM reply" / "orchestrating tools" periods that have nothing to do with compilation, opencode's own V8 runtime still sustains ~55% continuous high CPU. opencoder is the opposite — non-compilation CPU averages 0.13%, median 0; the agent is essentially silent while waiting.

> **Scope & credibility notes:**
> - All numbers in the table come from **non-compilation-period samples** (`npids<=1`, agent main process with no cargo/rustc child), fully symmetric on both sides. Compilation periods (opencode 2.5%, opencoder 4.8%) are all excluded.
> - **Wall-time is affected by LLM sampling randomness**: this run opencode 172.3 s / opencoder 112.2 s; the previous run was 125.7 s / 79.0 s in the opposite direction, so treat it as reference only, **not a steady-state conclusion**; CPU utilization and RSS are the stable differences in the runtime baseline.
> - opencode `run` bundles a V8 runtime and sustains resident high CPU/RSS; opencoder compiles to a native async runtime and drops CPU to ~0 while waiting for replies.
> - opencode also has a resident server daemon (≈285 MB) not counted here; in long-running server mode its resident overhead is even higher.
> - Raw CSV evidence (including the six `root_*` / `tree_*` / `npids` columns) is at [`docs/bench/opencode-vs-opencoder-2026-07-19/`](docs/bench/opencode-vs-opencoder-2026-07-19/).

## 🧪 Development & Testing

This repository maintains OpenCoder platform capabilities. External business implementations, workflows, and descriptions live separately under `/data00/opencoder-tools/`. Core builds and tests do not depend on that directory.



This project strictly follows the development rules under [`rules/`](rules/): every business feature must have corresponding tests, and a full regression run with a changelog + test manifest is required before each iteration ends.

```bash
# Unit + integration tests (deterministic, zero network)
cargo test --workspace

# Real-model end-to-end contract tests (~3–5 min, requires an API key)
scripts/e2e-glm.sh
```

See [`rules/03-test-pyramid.md`](rules/03-test-pyramid.md) for the test-layering spec.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

Thanks to the following open-source projects:

- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) — content search backend in notepad (falls back to `grep -rn` when unavailable)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) — managed sessions for `opencoder ts` (sessions survive SSH disconnects and reattach on reconnect)

Both are independent external projects: opencoder only invokes them at runtime and does not bundle or redistribute them.
